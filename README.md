## Exploratory Questions(SQL and Tableau)
  - **Question 1**: How do special requests affect hotel cancellation rates? 
  - **Question 2**: How does the cancellation rate vary across different seasons?
  - **Question 3**: What effect do hotel market segment types have on booking cancellations? 
  - **Question 4**: How far ahead should customers book their reservation?
## Objective of Modeling (RStudio)
- **Goal**: Predict whether a future booking will be canceled or not
- **Target(Y)**: "booking status"
- **Predictors(X)**: 16 potential variables such as "lead time", "special requests", etc.
- **Models**
  -  ***Logistic Regression***
  -  ***Default Decision Tree***
  -  ***Decision Tree with Control***
  -  ***Random Forest Tree Ensemble***
